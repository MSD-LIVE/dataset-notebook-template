# Creating Notebooks For Your Dataset
Instructions go here...


Important:
The GitHub repository must be public.
This repo must have a README and requirements file at the top level.
(Warn - End users will see the contents of this repo when opening the notebook)
(Warn – everything will be pulled means if there is lots of data it will take longer to spawn)
MSD-LIVE will provide each notebook with an environment variable named DATA_ROOT, which will point to the root directory of your dataset.  
All file paths used in the notebook must be relative to $HOME/data.
Pip install any libraries you need have to be added to notebooks – can this be done via requirements file?
